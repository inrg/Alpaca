Troubleshooting
=============

MSVCP140.dll is Missing
-----------
If you get this error message, ensure you have the VC++ 2017 Redistributable
installed. I've provided copies of Microsoft's redistributables for your
convenience in the "Other" directory.

Nothing happens when I start the game
-----------
This could occur for many reasons. On some systems you will need to run Alpaca.exe
in Admin Mode. You should also make sure that your video settings are properly
configured for D2 (Either Direct 3D or Glide).
