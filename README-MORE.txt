Development, Goals, Tips, License
=============
Internally, I'm slowly trying to improve the design of the application by
using OOP best practices and removing the massive usage of the preprocessor.
The application was originally designed as a C application saved in a .cpp
file (and using the C++ compiler).

Development
=============
Compiled with Visual Studio 2017.

Tips for working with Alpaca (in Visual Studio 2017)
=============
- All development is done with "Release" mode configuration.
- Don't release "Debug" builds to the public since most people
  don't have the the debugging DLLs installed. Only use the "Release"
  builds since those DLLs will be provided by the Microsoft Redistributables.
- There have been instances where weird and different behaviors happen between
  Release and Debug Modes. Test your stuff properly.
- Don't use /GS (Security Check)
- Don't use compiler optimizations
- Use the debugger and compile debugging symbols (.PDB)
- Use static classes and pointer to static functions in static classes
  if attempting to put naked functions in a class. C++ ISO standards
  does not support getting a function pointer to a instanced class function
  and calling it. When in doubt, just stick with regular C.

The reason for the above is because since the code uses a lot of
naked functions, there are times when the code directly maybe cause
an access violation, or something that could be perceived as an overflow.
Sometimes the code only works in Release mode but doesn't work in Debug mode.

Some of the above concerns/restrictions may be removed in the future if we can
continue to reduce the code base and test it properly.

Concerns
===========
- When using GlideWrapper, any message send operations that result in a visual change will look weird.
  > This affects the 'players 8' message (The message displayed is weird,
    workaround is to display above the head of the character).
  > The color that we set for an indexed page in the stash might be rendered differently in Glide.
    (Workaround: Use a color that is rendered the same in both Direct3D and Glide: Green).

Tips for updating to a new version of Diablo II
==============
- Look at each of the library header files and see what types of functions they declare.
  You can find all of the offsets currently being used by Alpaca in their corresponding
  implementation files.
- Search for all references of GetOffsetByAddition and GetOffsetByProc. That should further
  assist with offsets that need to be updated.
- Keep in mind that some offsets are constants and are not dynamically retrieved.
- There are still offsets scattered around the code that haven't yet been consolidated
  into a centralized location (Install Functions, etc, Look for: mem_seek)
- Even with all the offsets updated, there is probably going to be custom ASM code that
  you will need to write for the particular version you want to port for.

Good Luck!
