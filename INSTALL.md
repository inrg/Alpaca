## Installation

Copy the following files and folders to the root of your Diablo II directory:

- Alpaca/
- Alpaca.exe
- Alpaca.dll
- Alpaca.ini

Double click `Alpaca.exe` and Enjoy!

NOTE: If your Diablo II is installed in a protected directory
(C:\Program Files (x86)\), you might need to run it in Admin Mode.
I have my Diablo II installed in "D:\Games\Diablo II\" on Windows 10
and no Admin Mode is needed.

## Troubleshooting


### MSVCP140.dll is Missing

If you get this error message, ensure you have the VC++ 2017 Redistributable
installed. I've provided copies of Microsoft's redistributables for your
convenience in the "Other" directory.

### Nothing happens when I start the game

This could occur for many reasons as well. You should make sure that
your video settings are properly configured for D2 (Either Direct 3D or Glide).
