## Installation

1. Copy all the files in the "Files" folder to the root of your Diablo II directory.
2. Open D2GFEx.ini and add "Alpaca.dll" to one of the "LoadDll" lines.
3. Start up "Game.exe".

NOTE: If your Diablo II is installed in a protected directory
(C:\Program Files (x86)\), you might need to run it in Admin Mode.
I have my Diablo II installed in "D:\Games\Diablo II\" on Windows 10
and no Admin Mode is needed.

## Troubleshooting

### MSVCP140.dll is Missing

If you get this error message, ensure you have the VC++ 2017 Redistributable installed.
