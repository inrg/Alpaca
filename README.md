## Alpaca 3.0.5 ([Discord](https://discord.gg/PNJsaPa), [Cactus](https://github.com/fearedbliss/Cactus))
##### Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
##### Released on Wednesday, January 30, 2019

## Synopsis

Alpaca is an **`Infinite Stash`** for **`Diablo II: Lord of Destruction - v 1.10`**
that was based off Yohann Nicolas' **[PlugY](http://plugy.free.fr/en/index.html) 11.02**.
It has been massively refactored, stabilized, and is a minimal version of PlugY's core
feature, Infinite Stash. All Non-Stash features have been removed since they are outside the
scope of the project. Alpaca was also exclusively designed to work in conjunction with Necrolis'
Native OpenGL Diablo II Driver: **[D2GFEx](https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=65312)**.
Lastly, Alpaca is also compatible with my Diablo II Version Switcher: **[Cactus](https://github.com/fearedbliss/Cactus)**.
