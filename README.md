## Alpaca 3.0.3 ([Discord](https://discord.gg/PNJsaPa), [Cactus](https://github.com/fearedbliss/Cactus))
##### Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
##### Released on Saturday, January 19, 2019

## Synopsis

Alpaca is an Extended Stash Mod for **`Diablo II: Lord of Destruction - v 1.10`**
that was based off Yohann Nicolas' **[PlugY](http://plugy.free.fr/en/index.html) 11.02**. Alpaca is a massively
refactored, stabilized, and minimal version of PlugY's Extended
Stash functionality. It was exclusively designed to work in conjunction
with Necrolis' Native OpenGL Diablo II Driver: **[D2GFEx](https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=65312)**.
Alpaca is also compatible with my Diablo II Version Switcher: **[Cactus](https://github.com/fearedbliss/Cactus)**.
