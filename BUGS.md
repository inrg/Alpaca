## Known Bugs/Limitations

### Picked up item will be lost during character load (If stash contains an item)

If you have items in your stash, and then you pick up an item (and don't place it anywhere),
and save and exit, when you load the game it will be lost. This is an existing PlugY bug that
I wasn't able to fix. I spent a few hours looking around but it will take a way deeper
dive in order to resolve.
